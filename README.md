# hello-world
Hi Scientists and Social Scientists alike!

Name's Ivan and this is my first incursion into github. I am a Rutgers University MBS student in
Analytics: Discovery Informatics and Data Science. I am glad to see that their is a broad community that
supports each other in our projects no matter what they may be. Look forward to contributing my small grain
of sand as well as develop meaningful projects and count with everyone's help!

See you all around!
